# Experiment results

In this repository, the test models and the results from the experiments conducted in my master thesis can be found.

## ACMR-set
This is the models in a dataset referred to as the ACMR-set in my thesis. The original data set comes from Phuong T Nguyen et al. “Automated Classification of Metamodel Repositories: A Machine Learning Approach.” In: 2019 ACM/IEEE 22nd International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS). IEEE. 2019, pp. 272–282, but has been reduced to contain less models.

## AMOR-set
This is the models in a dataset referred to as the AMOR-set in my thesis. This set consists of 100 broken models that are mutated versions of 5 original conistent models, mutatet 20 times each.
